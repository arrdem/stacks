# Doctests

["doctests"](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/comp.lang.python/DfzH5Nrt05E/Yyd3s7fPVxwJ) are an old Python idea.

Documentation lives close to the definitions of our functions and so too should the tests.
Some subset of our tests are "interesting" and could be illustrative as examples, so what if we were to put examples in our documentation and also extract them as tests to keep them from going stale?
